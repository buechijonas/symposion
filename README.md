## In a Nutshell
Symposion is a web platform that blends forum discussions, social media interactions, and feedback management. It offers a space for users to engage in deep conversations, submit suggestions for improvements, and collaboratively document ideas. It’s a hub for exchanging thoughts, sharing knowledge, and enhancing community-driven projects.

## Why "symposion"?
The name Symposion is inspired by the ancient Greek concept of a symposium (Greek: συμπόσιον), a gathering where participants would engage in philosophical discussions, share ideas, and enjoy intellectual debates. In ancient Greece, a symposion was not just a social event, but a platform for exchanging knowledge, exploring new perspectives, and fostering collective growth.
In the same spirit, this platform aims to create a modern digital space where users can freely discuss, propose improvements, and collaboratively document knowledge. The name reflects the vision of bringing people together to contribute, learn, and grow in a community-driven environment.
